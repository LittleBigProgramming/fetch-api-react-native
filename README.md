# fetch-api-react-native

Simple demonstration of calling an API from within a React Native application on componentDidMount() and showing the data once successfully fetched. 

This data is then displayed in a FlatList. The data in this demo is retrieved from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The following image is the final result of the repo, this is intended to be a starting point for calling API's within RN and displaying them within a list.
